# :sparkles: rlyu-bot :sparkles:

`rlyu` is hanging out in the designated channel and waiting to celebrate you. :confetti_ball:

## What does it do?

`rlyu` will respond with some kind of power chant to any messages in its channel. :mega:

However, it will not respond when the message includes a special escape phrase. :speak_no_evil:

### Escape phrases list
* `really you`

## Under construction

Added a few todo/wishlist items on the [Home page of the project Wiki](https://github.com/eareese/rlyu-bot/wiki).
